      "question": "Discuss three advantages of dynamic (shared) linkage of libraries compared with static linkage. Describe two cases in which static linkage is preferable.",
      "student_answer": "The primary advantages of shared libraries are that they reduce the memory and disk space used by a system, and they enhance maintainability. When shared libraries are being used by all running programs, there is only one instance of each system library routine on disk, and at most one instance in physical memory. When the library in question is one used by many applications and programs, then the disk and memory savings can be quite substantial. In addition, the startup time for running new programs can be reduced, since many of the common functions needed by that program are likely to be already loaded into physical memory. Maintainability is also a major advantage of dynamic linkage over static. If all running programs use a shared library to access their system library routines, then upgrading those routines, either to add new functionality or to fix bugs, can be done simply by replacing that shared library. There is no need to recompile or relink any applications; any programs loaded after the upgrade is complete will automatically pick up the new versions of the libraries. There are other advantages too. A program that uses shared libraries can often be adapted for specific purposes simply by replacing one or more of its libraries, or even (if the system allows it, and most UNIXs including Linux do) adding a new one at run time. For example, a debugging library can be substituted for a normal one to trace a problem in an application. Shared libraries also allow program binaries to be linked against commercial, proprietary library code without actually including any of that code in the programs final executable file. This is important because on most UNIX systems, many of the standard shared libraries are proprietary, and licensing issues may prevent including that code in executable files to be distributed to third parties.",
